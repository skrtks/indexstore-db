To regenerate protobuf classes, set the correct protobuf versions in `lib/Proto/versions.config`. The Java version should 
reflect the runtime version used in the IntelliJ project. After that, run the `lib/Proto/generate.sh` script.

Please manually copy the updated Java classes to the correct place in the IntelliJ project.
